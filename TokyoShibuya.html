                        A major commercial center, Shibuya houses one of the busiest railway stations in the world, Shibuya Station.
                  As of January 1, 2024, Shibuya Ward has an estimated population of 230,609 in 142,443 households and a population density of 15,262.01 people per square kilometre (39,528.4 people/sq mi). 
                        The total area is 15.11 km2 (5.83 sq mi). 
                        Notable neighborhoods and districts of Shibuya include Harajuku, Ebisu, Omotesandō, Yoyogi and Sendagaya.

                    Shibuya came into the possession of the Shibuya clan in the early 1160s, 
                    after which the area was named. The branch of the clan that ruled this 
                    area was defeated by the Later Hōjō clan on January 13, 1524, during the Sengoku period, 
                    and the area then came under their control. During the Edo period, Shibuya, 
                    particularly Maruyamachō on Dōgenzaka, prospered as a town on Oyama Road (present-day Route 246), 
                    and in the Meiji era, as a Hanamachi. Shibuya emerged as a railway terminus during the expansion of the railway 
                    network beginning in the 19th century, 
                    and was incorporated as a ward in the City of Tokyo on October 1, 1932.

                    Shibuya, once a mediocre area developed around the railway terminus, overtook 
                    Shinjuku as a hub for youth culture in the 1970s. The coinciding competition between Seibu 
                    (whose most notable development projects include Shibuya Parco) and Tokyu (Tokyu Hands,Shibuya 109) 
                    to develop the area as a commercial center added to its appeal to young people, 
                    which in turn spread to other neighborhoods in the ward, such as Harajuku.

                    The Shibuya Scramble Crossing, known as the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world, 
                    the panoramic view of the city from the rooftop of Shibuya Scramble Square, 
                    and the statue of Hachikō are internationally recognized tourist attractions.

                    The area surrounding Shibuya Station has been undergoing large-scale redevelopment since 2010, 
                    with the entire project scheduled for completion in fiscal year 2034 (April 2034 to March 2035).

                    Shibuya came into the possession of the Shibuya clan in the early 1160s, after which the area was named. 
                    The clan was a cadet branch of the Taira clan descended from Taira no Yoshifumi. The clan built a fortress near 
                    the present-day Konnō Hachimangu Shrine. The branch of the clan that ruled this area was defeated by the Later 
                    Hōjō clan on January 13, 1524, during the Sengoku period, and the area then came under their control. During the 
                    Edo period, Shibuya, particularly Maruyamachō on Dōgenzaka, prospered as a town on Oyama Road (present-day Route 246)
                    , and in the Meiji era, as a Hanamachi.

                    The village of Shibuya was incorporated in 1889 by the merger of the villages of Kami-Shibuya, Naka-Shibuya and Shimo-Shibuya within Minami-Toshima County (Toyotama County from 1896). 
                    The village covered the territory of modern-day Shibuya Station area as well as the Hiroo, Daikanyama, Aoyama, and Ebisu areas. Shibuya became a town in 1909. 
                    The town of Shibuya merged with the neighboring towns of Sendagaya (which included the modern Senda, Harajuku and Jingumae areas) and Yoyohata 
                    (which included the modern Yoyogi and Hata areas) to form Shibuya-ku suburban ward upon being absorbed into Tokyo City in 1932. 
                    Shibuya became an urban special ward under the Local Autonomy Act in 1947.

                    The Tokyu Toyoko Line opened in 1932, making Shibuya a key terminal between Tokyo and Yokohama, 
                    and was joined by the forerunner of the Keio Inokashira Line in 1933 and the forerunner of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line in 1938. 
                    The story of Hachikō, a dog who waited for his deceased master at Shibuya Station every day from 1923 to 1935, created a national sensation due to his unwavering loyalty. 
                    A statue of Hachikō was built adjacent to the station, 
                    and the surrounding Hachikō Square is now one of the most popular meeting points in the area.

                    During the occupation of Japan, Yoyogi Park was used as a housing compound for U.S. personnel known as "Washington Heights". The U.S. military left in 1964, 
                    and much of the park was repurposed as venues for the 1964 Summer Olympics. The ward itself served as part of the athletics 50 km walk and marathon course during the 1964 games.[9]

                    In the mid-1990s, Shibuya-kei, a microgenre of pop music, became mainstream in Japan. Distinguished by a "cut-and-paste" approach, 
                    it peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving onto other music styles.

                    Since the beginning of the 21st century, large-scale redevelopment has been underway in the area surrounding Shibuya Station. The scale of the project has been described as something that happens once in a hundred years.
                    In 2005, the Japanese government designated the district as an Urban Renewal Area. Following discussions among scholars, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 
                    Shibuya City Office, and railway operators such as Tokyu Corporation, JR East, and Tokyo Metro, a master plan was announced in 2008.[10] In 2010, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government approved the implementation of the redevelopment plan,
                    and full-scale construction officially began.[11] As part of the redevelopment, the existing station facilities were demolished. The Tōyoko Line was moved underground, the Ginza Line platform was relocated, and the Saikyō Line platform was placed 
                    parallel to the Yamanote Line platform. Several existing commercial buildings were also demolished and replaced by high-rise complexes such as Shibuya Hikarie, Shibuya Stream, Shibuya Fukuras (ja), Shibuya Sakura Stage (ja), and Shibuya Scramble Square.
                    Because railway operations had to continue during construction, and because the pedestrian network plan around the station was revised during the process, the overall completion of the redevelopment is now scheduled for fiscal year 2034, which is seven 
                    years later than originally planned.
