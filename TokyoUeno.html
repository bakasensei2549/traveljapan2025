                        Ueno Park ( Japanese :上野公園;  Roman :  Ueno Kōen ) is a large public park in Ueno, Taitō -ku, Tokyo , Japan. The park was established in 1873 on the site of the former Kan'ei-ji Temple as one of the first public parks in Japan. Ueno Park was established in Western style, in part due to the borrowing and adaptation of international practices during the early Meiji period.
