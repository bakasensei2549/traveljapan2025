                    <Center><p>Ginza ( Japanese :銀座;  Romanji :  Ginza ), or as Thais like to call it "Ginza", is a district in the Chuo Ward, Tokyo , north of the Shimbashi district , south of the Yaesu and Kyobashi districts , west of the Tsukiji district , and east of the Yurakucho and Ushisaicho districts. It is famous for its many luxury shops and is also considered one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world.
                                Ginza was originally a marsh, and was later filled in during the 16th century. In 1612, during the Edo period, a mint was established there called Ginza, and the land was thus named after the mint.

                        In 1872, a fire destroyed most of the buildings in the area. [ 4 ] After the fire was put out, the Meiji government designated Ginza as a "model for modern development," planning to build fireproof brick buildings and wide roads connecting it to Shimbashi Station, the foreign-owned Tsukiji area, and various government offices. The Irish architect Thomas Waters was responsible for planning the land's development, [ 4 ] while the Department of Public Works, Ministry of Finance, took charge of the construction. The following year, a Western-style promenade began to open from the end of Shimbashi Bridge to the end of Kyousabi Bridge in the southwest of the Chuo Ward.

                    However, many of the Western buildings have now disappeared, leaving only a few that are old and well preserved, including the Wako (和光) store, whose clock tower is now a symbol of Ginza. The store and clock tower were the work of Kintaro Hattori (服部 金太郎), the founder of the Seiko ( Seiko) watch company.

                   The later development of Ginza has much to do with the Western-style shopping malls, as it became such a popular weekend destination that the main road from north to south was closed to traffic for tourism purposes in the 1960s by order of the then Tokyo Governor Ryōkichi Minobe (美濃部 亮吉).

                    Sensoji was built to worship the Bodhisattva Kannon. According to legend, 
                    around the year 628, there were two fishermen brothers named Hinoguma Hamanari 
                    and Hinoguma Takenari. Every day, they went fishing in the Sumida River. One day, 
                    they did not catch a single fish, so they prayed to the gods to catch one fish to eat 
                    for dinner. When they cast their net, what came up was a 5-inch golden statue of the 
                    Goddess of Mercy. They took it to the village chief, Hachino Nakamoto. The village chief 
                    realized the sacredness of the Goddess of Mercy, so he changed his house in Asakusa into a small 
                    temple to enshrine the Goddess of Mercy so that the villagers could come and worship it. Both the 
                    villagers and the samurai often came to pray to the Goddess of Mercy regularly, and their wishes 
                    were always granted. As a result, the villagers and the samurai greatly revered the Goddess of Mercy. 
                    The fame of the sacredness of the Goddess of Mercy spread throughout Japan. People from all over the 
                    country traveled to Zenwoji Temple to worship the Goddess of Mercy, and the news reached the Shogun. 
                    The Shogun ordered the construction of a larger building in 645 and continued to expand the structure 
                    to what we see today.
