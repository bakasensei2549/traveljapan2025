                    Nagoya City ( Japanese :名古屋市;  romaji :  Nagoya-shi ;  transcription : Nagoya-shi) is the largest city in the Chubu region and the fourth most populous city in Japan , with an estimated population of 2.3 million in 2020.

                    Located on the Pacific coast of Honshu Island, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and one of the major port cities in Japan, along with Tokyo , Osaka, Kobe , Yokohama, Chiba, and Kitakyushu. It is also the center of Japan's third largest metropolitan area, the Chugyo Metropolitan Area , with a population of over 10 million.

                    <center><p>
                        The name of the city was originally written in kanji as那古野 or 名護屋 (both pronounced as Nagoya ), which is likely derived from the word Nagoyaka (なごやか), meaning "peaceful", while the word Chukyo (中京, chū (middle) + kyo (metropolitan)) also refers to Nagoya. Examples of Chukyo's name include the Chukyo Metropolitan Area, Chukyo Industrial Area, Chukyo Broadcasting Company, Chukyo University , etc.

                        Oda Nobunaga and his subordinates Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful generals who unified Japan and had their bases in the Nagoya area. Later, after Ieyasu became shogun and established the Edo government in 1610, Ieyasu moved his base to Owari Province (present-day Aichi Prefecture), about seven kilometers from Kiyosu City , for strategic reasons in present-day Nagoya.

                        During this period , Nagoya Castle was built , using materials from Kiyosu Castle. During its construction, the area around Kiyosu Town was home to about 60,000 people, who later moved to the newly built Nagoya Castle area. [ 3 ] Around the same time, the area near Atsuta Shrine was designated as a resting point called a miya (shrine) on the Tokaido Road, which connected the capital city of Kyoto with the city of Edo (present-day Tokyo). This thoroughfare formed a community around the shrine.

                     Nagoya became the industrial center of the region, with new economic communities emerging, including the pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi , and Seto, and Okazaki, a gunpowder production center under the control of the Edo government. Other industries included textiles, cotton , and the doll-making industry known as Kamakura-ningyo.

                        During the Pacific War , Nagoya was one of the strategic bombing points for the United States Air Force, as it was one of the three largest aircraft manufacturing centers in Japan at the time. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated at around 1.5 million, and 25% of the population was employed in aircraft manufacturing. About 40-50% of Japan's engines and warplanes were manufactured here. In addition, Nagoya was a major production center for tools and equipment, such as friction materials, railway equipment, alloys, tanks, automobiles, and processed foods. Throughout the World War

                        The United States' aerial bombing campaign began on 18 April 1942, targeting the Mitsubishi Aircraft Factory , the Matsuhigejō Oil Depot, the Nagoya Castle Barracks, and munitions factories. [ 4 ] Incendiary bombing raids were occasionally used. The bombing continued into the spring of 1945. In this aerial bombing campaign, Bombing Command 21 used 3,162 tons of incendiary bombs, breaking the U.S. Air Force record. The command destroyed 23 targets and set a quarter of the city on fire. Nagoya Castle was also destroyed on 14 May 1945. [ 5 ] It was rebuilt and completed in 1959.
