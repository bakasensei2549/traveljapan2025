                        Sapporo (札幌市; Roman :  Sapporo-shi ;  transcription :  Sapporo-shi; Ainu :サッ・ポロ・ペッ; Sapporopet ) 
                        is the capital of Hokkaido, Japan , and the center of Ishikari Sub-prefecture. Sapporo is the center of development 
                        on the island and the fifth largest in the country, and one of the newest cities in Japan. It has a population of about 2 million, 
                        but in 1857 it had a pioneering population of only 7 people.

                        In the early Meiji period , when Hokkaido had just been established, and Sapporo was chosen as the center of 
                        management and development based on the advice of experts from the United States , 
                        Sapporo was built on a North American basis, and a rectangular street system was created.

                        Sapporo was the venue for the 1972 Winter Olympics and is now famous as a tourist city with ramen shops, the Sapporo Beer Brewery, and the Sapporo Snow Festival, held every February.

                        Before it became an administrative area, the area around Sapporo was called the Ishikari Plateau and was inhabited by the local Ainu people until 1866 towards the end of the Edo period when a canal was dug through the area, which encouraged more people to settle in the area, eventually becoming Sapporo Village. [ 2 ] The name Sapporo comes from the Ainu word sat -poro-pet ( Ainu :サッ・ポロ・ペッ, dry-big-river), meaning "large dry river".

                        1868 is the year officially recognized as the true birth of Sapporo. The government of Emperor Meiji concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, at that time the port city of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for the defense and development of the island. As a result, Ishikari Plain was designated as the administrative center of Hokkaido.

                    Between 1870 and 1871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, Vice Chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission, approached the U.S. government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, was hired by the Japanese government as a special advisor to the Development Commission. Construction of the city began around Odori Park , which remains a green space in the center of the growing city. The city was planned on a square grid in the American style.

                    The continued expansion of Japanese into Hokkaido, as a result of the migration from Honshu to the south, brought prosperity to Hokkaido and, in particular, capital was expanded to areas previously considered unnecessary by the Development Board, which had been abolished in 1882.

                    In 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was made Sapporo Ward , with railway lines to Temiya and Otaru. Two years later (1882), Kaitaku City was abolished. Hokkaido was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro, and while parts of Sapporo Prefecture were made wards, the city of Sapporo remained Sapporo Ward.

                        In 1886, Sapporo, Hakodate and Nemuro prefectures were abolished, and the Old Hokkaido Government Office , with its American neo-baroque architecture, was built in 1888.

                        Sapporo City administered Sapporo Ward until 1899, when a new system was announced. After that, Sapporo Ward became independent from Sapporo City (a city with a higher status than a city but lower than a metropolis), and at that time in Hokkaido, Hakodate and Otaru were still just wards.
