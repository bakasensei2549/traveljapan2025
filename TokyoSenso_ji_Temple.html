                        Sensoji is the site of Tokyo's largest and most popular festival. The festival lasts for three to four days in late spring, during which nearby roads are closed to traffic from morning until early evening.

At the entrance to the temple is a large gate called Kaminari-mon ("Thunder Gate"). Over the crossbar hangs a large paper lantern more than 5.5 meters high, with lightning and clouds drawn in black and red. The temple grounds are home to a five-story pagoda and the main building, which enshrines the Kannon Bosatsu (Guan Yin Bodhisattva) known to Thais.
                        Every year, many Japanese and foreign tourists visit Sensoji. The area around the temple is lined with shops selling traditional Japanese products and foods. Nakamise Shopping Street, which stretches from the Thunder Gate to the temple grounds, is lined with small shops selling souvenirs such as fans, wooden paintings, kimono, various types of robes, scroll paintings, traditional sweets, and even toy robots, T-shirts, and mobile phone accessories

                    Sensoji was built to worship the Bodhisattva Kannon. According to legend, 
                    around the year 628, there were two fishermen brothers named Hinoguma Hamanari 
                    and Hinoguma Takenari. Every day, they went fishing in the Sumida River. One day, 
                    they did not catch a single fish, so they prayed to the gods to catch one fish to eat 
                    for dinner. When they cast their net, what came up was a 5-inch golden statue of the 
                    Goddess of Mercy. They took it to the village chief, Hachino Nakamoto. The village chief 
                    realized the sacredness of the Goddess of Mercy, so he changed his house in Asakusa into a small 
                    temple to enshrine the Goddess of Mercy so that the villagers could come and worship it. Both the 
                    villagers and the samurai often came to pray to the Goddess of Mercy regularly, and their wishes 
                    were always granted. As a result, the villagers and the samurai greatly revered the Goddess of Mercy. 
                    The fame of the sacredness of the Goddess of Mercy spread throughout Japan. People from all over the 
                    country traveled to Zenwoji Temple to worship the Goddess of Mercy, and the news reached the Shogun. 
                    The Shogun ordered the construction of a larger building in 645 and continued to expand the structure 
                    to what we see today.
