                        Lake Toba ( Indonesian : Danau Toba ; Template:Lang-bbc ) is a large natural lake in North Sumatra, Indonesia, formed by the caldera of a large volcano. The lake is located in northern Sumatra and has a surface elevation of about 900 metres (2,953 ft). The lake spans from 2.88°N 98.52°E to 2.35°N 99.1°E , is about 100 kilometres (62 mi) long, 30 kilometres (19 mi) wide and up to 505 metres (1,657 ft) deep, making it the largest lake in Indonesia and the largest volcanic lake in the world. [ 1 ] The Lake Toba caldera is one of 20 geoparks in Indonesia, [ 2 ] which was inscribed as a UNESCO Global Geopark in July 2020.

                        Lake Toba was the site of a major VEI 8 volcanic eruption that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago. Recent advances in dating the eruption suggest that it occurred 74,000 years ago.This is the largest known eruption in the last 25 million years. The Toba Catastrophe Theory reports that the eruption had a global impact on human populations, killing off the majority of the population at the time and is believed to have caused a population bottleneck in central East Africa and India that has affected the genetic makeup of all modern humans.Recent research has begun to question this theory, and no evidence of large-scale population shifts has been found.However, it is widely accepted that the Toba eruption triggered a volcanic winter, with global temperatures dropping by between 3 and 5 °C, but at higher latitudes by up to 15 °C. Further studies in Lake Malawi in East Africa have shown that ash from the Toba eruptions, although widely spaced, has little indication of climate change in East Africa

                    <center><p>The Toba caldera complex in northern Sumatra consists of four overlapping calderas and is adjacent to the Sumatran volcanic belt. The youngest caldera is the largest Quaternary caldera in the world and is intersected with three older calderas. During one of the largest volcanic eruptions in geological history, it ejected approximately 2,800 cubic kilometers of sediment. These sediments are known as Toba's youngest ash. After the eruption, a dome formed within the new caldera by the merging of two domes bisected by a long graben</p></center>
                    <br>
                    <center><p>The lake contains four volcanic cones, three stratovolcanoes and three visible calderas. Tanduk Benuva, on the northwestern rim of the caldera, has relatively little vegetation, indicating its relative youth of only several hundred years, while Pusubukit, on the southern rim, remains active as a volcanic eruption.</p></center>

                    <center><p>The Toba eruption occurred at the site of present-day Lake Toba approximately 67,500–75,500 years ago . It was the latest in a series of at least three caldera-forming volcanic eruptions, preceded by a series of calderas that were approximately 700,000–840,000 years old The last eruption was rated a magnitude 8 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, making it probably the largest volcanic eruption in the past 25 million years.</p></center>

                    <br>
                    <center><p>Bill Rose and Craig Chesner of Michigan Technological University have estimated that the total volume of material ejected was about 2,800 cubic kilometers  of this, about 2,000 cubic kilometers of ignimbrite were scattered along the ground and about 800 kilometers of ash, much of which was blown westward by winds. The eruption destroyed an area of 20,000 square kilometers, with ash deposits as thick as 600 meters</p></center>
                    <br>
                    <center><p>Although the exact year of the eruption cannot be determined, it is likely to have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere summer</p></center>
                    <br>
                    <center><p>The collapse following the eruption created a caldera that was later filled with water to form Lake Toba, while an island in the center of the lake formed from a resurgent dome. the summer monsoon could transport ash from Toba to the South China Sea. The eruption may have lasted for two weeks, but the ensuing "volcanic winter" cooled global average temperatures by 3–3.5 °C for several years. Ice cores from Greenland show a cyclic decline in organic matter excretion, while few plant and animal life survived in Southeast Asia, and the eruption is likely to have caused a worldwide mass extinction.</p></center>
                    <br>
                    <center><p>Evidence from mitochondrial DNA suggests that the human species may have experienced a genetic bottleneck around that time, reducing genetic diversity to a level far below what would be expected given the species' relative antiquity. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the outbreak could have reduced the human population to just a few tens of thousands of people. [ 21 ] However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted, due to the lack of evidence of mass extinctions or extinctions of other species, even environmentally sensitive ones. [ 22 ]</p></center>

                        <center><h1>Recent movements</h1></center>
                        <center><p>Less violent eruptions have occurred at Toba in recent times. A small cone of the Pusubukit volcano formed on the southwestern rim of the caldera and a lava dome. The most recent eruption may have occurred at the Tanduk Benuva cone on the northwestern rim of the caldera, as there is little vegetation in the area, probably due to eruptions within the past few hundred years. Some calderas have been uplifted by partially filling the magma chambers. Examples include Samosir Island and the Uluwan Peninsula, which have been uplifted above the lake surface. Sediments from the lakebed on Samosir Island show that the island has been uplifted at least 450 m since the major eruption. [ 15 ] Such uplift is common in very large calderas, depending on the upward pressure of unerupted igneous rock , and Toba may be the largest newly formed caldera in the world. Recent large earthquakes have occurred in the volcanic area, most notably the 1987 temblor along the southern shore of the lake, with an epicentre 11 km below the ground. [ 24 ] Other earthquakes in the area occurred in 1892, 1916, and 1920–1922.</p></center>
                        <br>
                        <center><p>Lake Toba lies near the Greater Sumatran Fault , which runs through the center of the island of Sumatra on the Sumatra Fault Belt. [ 15 ] The volcanoes on Sumatra and Java are part of the Sunda Volcanic Islands, which formed when the Indian-Australian Plate moved northeastward and subducted beneath the eastward-moving Eurasian Plate. The subduction zone in this area is very active, with the seafloor off the west coast of Sumatra having been the site of several major earthquakes since 1995, including the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake of magnitude 9.1 and the 2005 Sumatra earthquake of magnitude 8.7, both of which had epicenters approximately 300 km from Lake Toba.</p></center>
                        <br>
                        <center><p>On September 12, 2007, a magnitude 8.5 earthquake struck the island of Sumatra and was felt in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta . This time, the epicenter was not as close as the previous two, but was in the same vicinity. On October 26, 2010, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck 36 kilometers southwest of nearby Pagai Selatan Island, and was immediately followed by a 3-meter tsunami.

On January 10, 2012, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck the area.</p></center>
