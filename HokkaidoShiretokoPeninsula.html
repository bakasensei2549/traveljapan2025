                        The Shiretoko Peninsula (知床半島;  shiretokohantō ;  Shiretoko Hantō) is located at the easternmost point of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, in the Sea of Okhotsk. The peninsula is separated from the Russian island of Kunashir by the Nemuro Strait. The  name Shiretoko comes from the Ainu word sir etok , meaning "edge of the land" or "point where the land juts out". The towns of Rausu and Shari are located on the peninsula

                       On 14 July 2005, at a World Heritage Committee meeting held in the Republic of South Africa, the Committee declared the Shiretoko Peninsula a World Heritage Site under the name Shiretoko , and it was officially inscribed on 17 July. This peninsula is unique in that it is the southernmost point in the Northern Hemisphere where sea ice normally forms.
