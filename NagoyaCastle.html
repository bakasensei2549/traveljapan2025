                        Nagoya Castle (名古屋城) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture , Japan . It was originally built by Imagawa Ujichika around 1525, and was seized by Oda Nobuhide in 1532 from Imagawa Ujitoyo, but later abandoned.
                    In 1610 , Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the castle to be rebuilt on the same site. Construction was completed in 1612.

                        On the castle's roof are a pair of golden tiger-headed fish sculptures called "Kinshachi", which were used as amulets to protect against fire and were also said to symbolize the power of the feudal lords. The pair of Kinshachi were displayed at the Expo 2005 from March 19 to June 19, 2005 , and were returned to the castle on July 9 of the same year.
